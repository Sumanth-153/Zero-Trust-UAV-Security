# Zero-Trust-UAV-Security
A Zero Trust Architecture–based UAV security system that uses role-based access control, encrypted communication, and AI-driven anomaly detection to protect UAV telemetry and control operations in real time.

🔹 Project Overview

This project implements a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)–based UAV Security System to protect military UAV telemetry and control channels. It integrates role-based access control, encrypted communication, AI-driven anomaly detection, and explainable AI to secure UAV operations in real time.

🔹 Key Features

Zero Trust authentication using JWT
Role-based access (Admin / Pilot / Viewer)
Real-time telemetry monitoring
AI-based anomaly detection
Explainable AI (XAI) for anomaly reasoning
Audit logging for critical actions
Secure dashboard using Flask & Socket.IO

🔹 Technology Stack

Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO
Security: JWT, TLS
AI/ML: Scikit-learn, NumPy
Hardware: Raspberry Pi, MPU6050, INA219
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
